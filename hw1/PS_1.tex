\section*{Problem 2.1}

To walk “downhill” on the loss function (equation 2.5), we measure its gradient with respect to the parameters $\phi_0$ and $\phi_1$. Calculate expressions for the slopes $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi_0}$ and $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi_1}$.

\section*{Problem 2.2}

Show that we can find the minimum of the loss function in closed-form by setting the expression for the derivatives from Problem 2.1 to zero and solving for $\phi_0$ and $\phi_1$.
