\section*{Problem 5.9}
Consider a multivariate regression problem in which we predict the height of an individual in meters and their weight in kilos from some data $x$. Here, the units take quite different values. What problems do you see this causing? Propose two solutions to these problems.

\section*{Problem 6.6}
Which of the functions in Figure~6.11 from the book is convex? Justify your answer. Characterize each of the points 1--7 as (i) a local minimum, (ii) the global minimum, or (iii) neither.

\section*{Problem 6.10}
Show that the momentum term \( m_t \) (equation (6.11)) is an infinite weighted sum of the gradients at the previous iterations and derive an expression for the coefficients (weights) of that sum.
